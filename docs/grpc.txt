Curently the PersonWS only supports creating persons, but ideally this should migrate (out of the scope for this project)
all other data retrieval except creating locations and connections (which are sent to Kafka for LocationWS).

Current grpc protobuf (see /modules/personws):
message PersonMessage {
  string first_name = 1;
  string last_name = 2;
  string company_name = 3;
  optional int32 id = 4;
}

service PersonService {
    rpc Create(PersonMessage) returns (PersonMessage);
}

For dev testing, I created: ....\modules\personws\app\test_writer.py
But the current implementation, I was using through the Rest API using the Gateway API.
I was using Postman - POST, to http://localhost:30001/api/persons
Json: payload:
    {
        "first_name": "GE3",
        "company_name": "GE Corp3",
        "last_name": "ge ln3"
    }
Then you should see it in the UI or through REST API: http://localhost:30001/api/persons

This is used by GatewayWS as the Person producer. This is to send through GRPC a Person
to be consumed by this PersonWS (person web service) to ultimately land in DB.

The requirements.txt needs to be added as part of the GatewayWS, as well as the
generated person_pb2* stubs generated for GRPC.

Currently, this code (person_pb2* protobuf, including additional dependencies from requirements) was copied over api module, but ideally this should be done during the build process.

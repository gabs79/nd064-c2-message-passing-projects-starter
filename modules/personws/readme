person webservice (WS)

this uses grpc
generates grpc client/server stubs

client stubs, are used by the Gateway WS
server stubs, by this WS which is a container that instantiates the server, listens and push to DB
  current migration, only to push person... but ideally, remove DB dep from GatewayAPI and all through this WS

execute:
pip install grpcio-tools grpcio

python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./ --python_out=./ --grpc_python_out=./ person.proto

added sqlite for mem testing. once in .venv-runtime, added to pip install, but not to the requirements.
it seems already installed in python > 2.7
sqlite only for testing

local testing:
  > start docker
  > start db: postgis
    > update app/dao/config.py for string below
    > docker run --rm --name ge-postgis -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_USER=user -e POSTGRES_DB=gedb -d postgis/postgis:12-2.5-alpine
  > activate .venv-runtime (Scripts/  . activate [bash console])
  > <oneline-fetcher> pip install -r requirements-runtime.txt
  >  <online-fetcher/app> python server.py
  > exec writer.py / testdb.py etc.

this will be the apiserver WS

currently added the /version route, which upgraded ge version

test locally: on root for this module, execute
    flask run (not 0.0.0.0)
    this runs in 127.0.0.1:5000/version

TODO: remove DB connection, and add it to other WS (personws, etc)
this should only forward accordingly
